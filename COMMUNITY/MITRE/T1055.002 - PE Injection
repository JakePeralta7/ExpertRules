# T1055.002 - PE Injection

## Author
Elad levi

## Description
This Expert rule detects allocation of memory in remote process and image load right after that, which indicates PE injection.

## Rule Class 
Process

## Rule TCL
```tcl
Rule {
	Process {
		# Exclude processes signed by a Trellix or Microsoft
		Exclude VTP_TRUST true
	}
	Target {
		Match PROCESS {
			Include OBJECT_NAME {
				-v **
			}
			# PAGE_READWRITE memory protection
			Include -nt_access "0x04"
		}
		Next_Process_Behavior {
			Target {
				Match SECTION {
					Include OBJECT_NAME {
						-v **
					}
					# Notification only (cannot block the image load)
					Include -access "LOAD_IMAGE"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Tested Platforms
NA

## Notes
- Customers are advised to fine-tune the rule in their environment or disable the signature if there are false positives.
- Because I've used the access mask LOAD_IMAGE the signature cannot be used for prevention
